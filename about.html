			<h2>Introduction</h2>
	    	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
	    	<p>I'm a 32 year-old Web Developer with two MS degrees in the fields of psychology and counseling. My goal is to lead others to Christ by my example. I am passionate about helping others. With web design and development, I am able to express my creativity and organizational skills.</p>

			<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
	    	<p>I was born and raised in the middle Tennessee town of Columbia, TN. After college, I started my first job as a youth minister in Glasgow, KY. After discovering my passion for counseling, I moved to Nashville, TN for my graduate degrees. For the last three years, I have lived in Humboldt, TN with my lovely wife.</p>

			<h2>More About Me</h2>
		    <h3>What are My Favorite Hobbies?</h3>
		    <p>When I am not buidling websites, I love to study more about technology. I am an advid comicbook reader and fan. In addition, I love to play video games and even have a YouTube page devoted to Let's Play walkthroughs. My favorite show of all time is LOST, and I like any film/show by David Fincher.</p>
		    <h3>What Is My Dream Job?</h3>
		    <p>My "Dream Job" would allow for me to work from home and allow for time to spend with my family. I would love to work for AAA gaming companies such as Bethesda, helping them with UI or any front-end development. It would also be a dream to work for a company like Google or even start a start-up and build a company of my own. I do see myself designing apps that are practical and possibly have a connection to video gaming.</p>
		    <h3>What music have I been listening to lately?</h3>
		    <p>I'm very excited for the new Weezer album that is available for pre-order now. This will be the "White Album," and it already has a few songs that have been released. I have been listening to a lot of sports talk lately, as the NFL draft is weeks away. Mainly, I tune into 104.5 in Nashville, TN to hear more news and analysis about my favorite team, the Tennessee Titans.</p>
		    <h3>What games have you been playing lately?</h3>
		    <p>My Fallout 4 play has slowed down a lot since I have had pneumonia, but I am excited about the new DLC coming in April as well as the tweeks to the Survival difficulty level. I also have a hankering to buy The Division as I have watched several walkthroughs and like the concept more each day. I'm intrigued by Black Ocean Online, but will probably pass on this MMORPG.</p>
